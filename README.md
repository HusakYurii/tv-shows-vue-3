# tv-shows
The project was generated using vue CLI tools.

To run this project, first make sure you have __Node v14.18.0 or higher installed__. 
Then install a few extensions to your VS code to add better support of Vue and TypeScript. Those extensions are Vue Language Features (Volar) and TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar).

Use `npm ci` to install all of the dependencies. Lastly, run `npm run dev`. That will build files and run local host.
